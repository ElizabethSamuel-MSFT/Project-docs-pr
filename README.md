# Project-docs-pr

This repository contains API files for ProjectOnline. The files use markdown formatting that are transformed to HTML when published. 
Each file contains normal reference information, including description, name, and other considerations. Additionally, each file 
includes syntax for the .NET interface (CSOM), the javaScript interface (JSOM), and the REST api entry.

Previous versions of this documentation separated information by syntax, with one file for CSOM and a second file for 
both JavaScript and REST APIs.
